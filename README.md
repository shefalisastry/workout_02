# Workout 02

## This Workout was created for the STAT 133 class. The work here is an interactive Shiny app version of the work completed for our Warmup 6 assignment. 

### Shiny App Deliverable: [Savings-Investings Modalities: An Interactive Visualization](https://shefalis.shinyapps.io/workout02app-shefali-sastry/)

#### The focus is to understand the impact of savings and investing decisions. This work is based on the fact that “it turns out that millenials are actually just as good, or better, than other generations when it comes to managing money. . .," according to  Bank of America’s *2018 Better Money Habits Millenial Report.*

#### This work looks at three types of savings-investing scenarios. The code from the Shiny app allows users to manipulate six different features. These features are:
* Initial Amount
* Annual Contribution
* Return Rate (in %)
* Years
* Growth Rate (in %)
* Facet? (This last option allows you to see each plot individually)
